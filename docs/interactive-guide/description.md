# Tokenization

## Network Tokenization Overview

- **What is Tokenization:**
    - Tokenization,is the process of substituting a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent, referred to as a token, ‒ that has no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value.

    - The token is a reference (i.e. identifier) that maps back to the sensitive data through a tokenization system. ‒

    - The mapping from original data to a token uses methods which render tokens infeasible to reverse in the absence of the tokenization system, for example using tokens created from random numbers. ‒

    - The tokenization system provides data processing applications with the authority and interfaces to request tokens, or detokenize back to sensitive data.

- **What is Network Token?**
    - Token provided by Schemes are called  Network Token.

    - Master card Network Tokenization Program is called MasterCard Digital Enablement Service (MDES)

    - Visa  Tokenization services called Visa Token Services (VTS).

    - Similarly, every scheme like AMEX , Diners have developed their Tokenization Programme.

- **What are the benefits to Merchants?**
    - Currently merchant faces lots of declines due to stale credentials, with network tokens, credentials on file are always valid, and it will improve the payment success rates.
